Pre Req: 
- Open up index.html for the main demo page. 
- You will find TestText.exe and the TCP/Socket program in the folder labeled "websocket".


Instructions: 
1. Resize the browser window using ctrl+ or ctrl- until all the elements are shown and not overlaying over each other. It is recommended to zoom out in to a size in which the watch image is at a reasonably accurate size.
2. Click on Connect to TextTest to initialize the system. If the TextTest and TCP/Socket executable are not running, an error will be shown. Make sure that TextTest is first running and is accepting characters over network, and the TCP/Socket exe is also working.
3. To get upper case keys, move the slider to a number greater than 60 or less than 40. Move it again to return to lower case. 
4. Click on a button to reveal the call outs. Mouse over the call outs to enter that key. Click on the button again to remove the callouts without selecting any. 
5. To enter the phrase, click on the send button and then the next button in TextTest.
